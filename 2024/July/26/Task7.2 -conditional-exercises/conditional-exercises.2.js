// ## More Difficult Exercises (21-30)

// 21. Write nested if-else statements that check if a variable `number` is positive, negative, or zero, and then check if it's even or odd. Set variables `sign` and `parity` accordingly.
//     Hint: Use nested if-else statements and the modulus operator (%).

// 22. Create nested if-else statements that check a variable `score` and a variable `attendance`. Set `grade` based on the score, but lower it by one level if attendance is less than 80%.
//     Hint: Use nested if-else statements with multiple conditions.

// 23. Write an if-else statement that checks if a year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, except for century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
//     Hint: Use multiple conditions with logical operators (&&, ||).

// 25. Write a switch statement with fall-through cases that categorizes a variable `month` into seasons, where some months can belong to multiple seasons.
//     Hint: Use fall-through cases in a switch statement.

// 26. Create an if-else statement that determines the quadrant (1, 2, 3, or 4) of a point on a coordinate plane, given variables `x` and `y` for the coordinates.
//     Hint: Use nested if-else statements to check the signs of x and y.

// 29. Write an if-else statement that determines if three numbers can form a triangle. Use variables `a`, `b`, and `c` for the side lengths.
//     Hint: Check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.

// 30. Create nested if-else statements that calculate the roots of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) based on the discriminant. Use variables `a`, `b`, and `c` for the coefficients.
//     Hint: Use nested if-else statements to handle different cases (two real roots, one real root, or no real roots).

// ## Ternary Operator Exercises (31-32)

// 31. Use the ternary operator to check if a variable `number` is even or odd. Set a variable `parity` to "even" or "odd" accordingly.
//     Hint: Use the modulus operator (%) with the ternary operator.
